## Accessing flight log files

### DJI Flight Logs

You first need to collect the DJI flight log files that you can import to this application. This project supports modern DJI log files in the `.txt` format. For DJI fly apps on Android or RC remotes, they are usually in `Internal Storage > Android > data > dji.go.v5 > files > FlightRecord`. For iOS, Connect your iPhone/iPad to a computer, open iTunes/Finder, select the device, go to the "File Sharing" tab, select the DJI app, and copy the "Logs" folder. If you are already using other online sync applications, you can download the original logs files directly from there too. 

You can find more details resources from this simple [google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=where+can+i+find+the+DJI+log+files&oq=where+can+i+find+the+DJI+log+files)

### Litchi CSV Exports

Litchi flight logs can be exported as CSV files from the Litchi app.  Litchi-imported flights are automatically tagged with "Litchi" for easy filtering.

### Airdata Exports

If you use Airdata to sync your flight logs, you can export the original DJI log files directly from the Airdata website:

1. Go to your [Airdata flight logs](https://app.airdata.com/) and click on `my account`
2. In the left sidebar, under `My Data` secction, pick `Download my data`
3. Click **Request Export** and wait for their email with zip containing the `.txt` files

![Airdata Export Guide](screenshots/Airdata_Export_Guide.png)

These exported log files can then be imported directly into Open DroneLog.
## Setup and installation (Windows/MacOS)

There is no installation step if you want to use the standalone binary builds, just visit the latest [release page](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/open-dronelog/releases), and download the appropriate binary for Windows or MacOS and run them.

> [!WARNING]
> For macOS, there are [additional steps](#macos-users-damaged-file-error-fix) required before you can use the application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you are copying from RC or mobile device, you can NOT directly drag and drop the files to the interface. This is because these external devices are mounted differently and only accessible to the file manager. Please copy the files to a local folder or the device sync folder before trying to upload or sync. 

> [!TIP]
> Explore the [full manual](/docs/manual.md) if you want to have a comprehensive overview of all the available options and features inside the app.

<a href="https://app.opendronelog.com">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Launch-Webapp-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=globe" alt="Launch Webapp" height="48"/>
</a>
<br><br>

- **Zero setup** – just open the link in your browser
- **Perfect for evaluation** – see if the tool fits your needs before installing
- **Single flight visualization** – upload and analyze one flight log at a time
- **All core features** – view telemetry charts, 3D flight path replay, and flight statistics
- **No data persistence** – your data is processed locally in the browser and not stored on any server

> **Note:** For the full experience with multi-flight management, database persistence, filtering, overview analytics, and backup/restore capabilities, use the desktop app or self-hosted Docker deployment. 

### macOS Users: "Damaged File" Error Fix

<img width="320" height="311" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2787ffff-9961-433c-898a-b548c738f1a2" />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you see **"Drone Logbook is damaged and can't be opened"** on macOS, this is a Gatekeeper security warning for unsigned apps, **not a corrupted file**. Apple charges $99/year for developer signing, so we provide these free workarounds instead.

#### Method 1: Right-Click to Open

This is the simplest method and works for most users:

1. **Locate the app** in your Applications folder (or wherever you placed it after downloading)
2. **Right-click** (or Control+click) on "Drone Logbook.app"
3. **Select "Open"** from the context menu
4. **Click "Open"** in the dialog that appears

#### Method 2: Terminal Command

Open **Terminal** (search for "Terminal" in Spotlight) and run:

Simply type `xattr -cr ` (with a space at the end), then **drag and drop** the app onto the Terminal window - it will auto-fill the file path:

```bash
xattr -cr <delete-this-part-after-cr-and-drag-and-drop-the-app-here>
```

Then press Enter and try opening the app again.

## Usage

1. **Import a Flight Log**: Click "Browse Files" or drag-and-drop a drone log file
2. **Select a Flight**: Click on a flight in the sidebar
3. **Analyze Data**: View telemetry charts and the 3D flight path on the map
4. **Filter/Search/Sort**: Use date range, drone/device, battery serial filters, search, and sorting
5. **Overview Analytics**: Sidebar filters (date, drone, battery, duration) automatically apply to overview statistics
5. **Export**: Use the Export dropdown in the stats bar (CSV/JSON/GPX/KML)
6. **Backup & Restore**: Use Settings → Backup Database to export, or Import Backup to restore
7. **Configure Settings**: Set API key, theme, units, and view app data/log directories


## Building from source (Linux users)

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (1.70+)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (18+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or npm


```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/open-dronelog
cd open-dronelog

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run tauri
```

## Docker deployment (Self-hosted Web)

The app can also be deployed as a self-hosted web application using Docker. This uses an Axum REST backend instead of Tauri IPC, with Nginx serving the frontend and proxying API requests.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Web interface is primarily designed for Desktop or larger screen viewing. Basic mobile responsiveness is available but the full experience is best on larger screens.

### Quick start (recommended)

Pull the pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/arpanghosh8453/open-dronelog:latest

docker run -d \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v drone-data:/data/drone-logbook \
  --name open-dronelog \
  ghcr.io/arpanghosh8453/open-dronelog:latest
```

Or use docker-compose (uses the same pre-built image):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/open-dronelog
cd open-dronelog
docker compose up -d
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

### Building locally from source

If you want to build the Docker image from source instead of pulling the pre-built one:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/open-dronelog
cd open-dronelog
docker compose -f docker-compose-build.yml up -d
```

> **Note:** The initial build takes ~10–15 minutes (Rust compilation). Subsequent rebuilds are much faster thanks to Docker layer caching.

### Data persistence

All flight data (DuckDB database, cached decryption keys, and optionally uploaded log files) is stored in a Docker named volume (`drone-data`) mapped to `/data/drone-logbook` internally inside the container. Data persists across container restarts, image updates, and rebuilds. It is only removed if you explicitly delete the volume with `docker compose down -v`.

When `KEEP_UPLOADED_FILES=true` is set, original log files are preserved in an `uploaded` subfolder using their SHA256 hash as filename for deduplication.

### Environment variables

| Variable        | Default                | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DATA_DIR`      | `/data/drone-logbook`  | Database and config storage                                                 |
| `RUST_LOG`      | `info`                 | Log level (debug, info, warn)                                               |
| `DJI_API_KEY`   | (bundled default)      | Set your own for better rate limits. See [How to obtain your own DJI Developer API key](#how-to-obtain-your-own-dji-developer-api-key). |
| `SYNC_LOGS_PATH`| (not set)              | Path to internal folder for automatic log import (e.g., `/sync-logs`)       |
| `SYNC_INTERVAL` | (not set)              | Cron expression for scheduled sync (e.g., `0 0 */8 * * *` for every 8 hours)|
| `KEEP_UPLOADED_FILES` | `true`      | When `true`, keeps copies of uploaded log files in the `uploaded` folder    |
| `PROFILE_CREATION_PASS` | (not set) | Master password required for creating or deleting profiles in web/Docker mode. When unset, anyone can create and delete profiles. |
| `SESSION_TTL_HOURS` | `24`           | Session token lifetime in hours. After expiry the user must re-authenticate. |

### Automatic log sync (Docker)

You can mount a folder containing your drone flight logs and have the app automatically import new files:

1. Uncomment the volume mount in `docker-compose.yml` and set the path to your logs folder:
   ```yaml
   - /path/to/your/drone/logs:/sync-logs:ro
   ```
2. Uncomment the `SYNC_LOGS_PATH` environment variable:
   ```yaml
   - SYNC_LOGS_PATH=/sync-logs
   ```
3. (Optional) Enable scheduled automatic sync by setting a cron expression:
   ```yaml
   - SYNC_INTERVAL=0 0 */8 * * *
   ```
4. Restart the container.

**Sync behavior:**
- Without `SYNC_INTERVAL`: Manual sync only - use the "Sync" button in the web interface to import new files
- With `SYNC_INTERVAL`: The server automatically syncs at the scheduled times, plus manual sync via the button

**Common cron expressions:**
| Expression | Schedule |
|------------|----------|
| `0 0 */8 * * *` | Every 8 hours |
| `0 0 0 * * *` | Daily at midnight |
| `0 0 */2 * * *` | Every 2 hours |
| `0 30 6 * * *` | Daily at 6:30 AM |
| `0 0 0 * * 0` | Weekly on Sunday at midnight |

The sync status and a manual "Sync" button will appear in the Import section when configured. During sync, the app shows file-by-file progress (current filename, X of Y counter) matching the desktop app experience.

### Keep uploaded files (Docker)

To retain copies of uploaded log files in Docker, enable the `KEEP_UPLOADED_FILES` environment variable (`true` by default):

Uploaded files are stored in `/data/drone-logbook/uploaded` inside the container (part of the `drone-data` volume). You can adjust the external mount volume to have direct access.

> [!TIP]
> You can set the external host path same for both `/sync-logs` and `/data/drone-logbook/uploaded` to unify the log file collection. Make sure to remove the `:ro` part from the `/sync-logs` mount. I do it myself for convinience, but we recommend our users to keep them separate to make sure you accidentally don't lose any log files from the sync folder due to overwrite or any issue with the application. 


## Profiles and Password Protection

Open DroneLog supports multiple named profiles. Each profile is a fully isolated environment with its own database, config, uploads, and sync folder. Profiles are managed from the **profile selector** dropdown in the header.

### Creating and switching profiles

- Click the profile selector (top-left, next to the logo) and choose **New Profile**
- Enter a name and, optionally, a password to protect it
- Switch between profiles by selecting them from the dropdown
- Each browser tab can be on a different profile (uses `sessionStorage` for isolation)

### Password protection

- Set, change, or remove a profile password from **Settings → Profile Password**
- Protected profiles display a lock icon and prompt for a password when switching to them
- Passwords are hashed with **argon2id** and verified server-side
- In web/Docker mode, a session token is issued after successful authentication and sent via the `X-Session` header
- **Lockout policy**: 5 consecutive failed attempts lock the profile for 60 seconds

### Master password (web/Docker only)

Set the `PROFILE_CREATION_PASS` environment variable to require a master password for creating and deleting profiles. This is useful for shared or publicly exposed instances.

```yaml
environment:
  - PROFILE_CREATION_PASS=your-secret-master-password
```

When set, any create or delete operation must include the matching master password.

## Security Warning (Web/Docker)

> [!WARNING]
> **Open DroneLog is designed as a local-first application and does NOT include TLS/HTTPS.** If you expose your instance to the internet, passwords and session tokens are transmitted in **plaintext** over HTTP.

**Strongly recommended for internet-facing deployments:**

1. **Use a reverse proxy** (e.g., Nginx, Caddy, Traefik) with TLS termination in front of the container
2. **Do not expose port 80 directly** to the public internet without encryption
3. Set `PROFILE_CREATION_PASS` to prevent unauthorized profile creation

### Security limitations

| Area | Limitation |
|------|------------|
| **Transport** | No built-in TLS - passwords and tokens sent in plaintext over HTTP |
| **Session storage** | Sessions are in-memory only; a server restart invalidates all sessions |
| **CSRF** | No CSRF token; relies on same-origin policy and the `X-Session` / `X-Profile` custom headers |
| **Brute force** | Argon2id provides strong hashing, but without TLS an attacker on the network can intercept tokens via MITM|

For production deployments, a reverse proxy with TLS is essential.

## Configuration

- **DJI API Key**: Stored locally in `config.json`. You can also provide it via `.env` or via the `settings` menu inside the application. The standalone app ships with a default key, but users should enter their own to avoid rate limits for log file decryption key fetching.
- **Sync folder**: Set and use the `sync folder` (application interface for Desktop and ENV variable for docker) for seamless log file import and re-import with de-duplication. The files uploaded through drag and drop or browse are also collected by default in the `Uploaded` folder of application storage (customizable via settings options for Desktop and ENV variable for docker). You can use a common folder (essentially unifying the raw log files storage location), but that is not generally recommended to prevent any mishaps or file overwrites.  
- **Database Location**: Stored in the platform-specific app data directory (e.g., AppData on Windows, Application Support on macOS, and local share on Linux). In Docker mode, data is stored in `/data/drone-logbook` (persisted via a Docker volume).
- **API Guide**: Available API request paths and response structure is provided in the [API documentation](/docs/api-guide.md) page. 
- **Log Files**: App logs are written to the platform-specific log directory and surfaced in Settings. In Docker mode, logs are written to stdout.

## How to obtain your own DJI Developer API key

> [!NOTE]
> Unless you set up your own API key, the import process will be rate limited because you are using a shared key (provided by me) for the project alongside other users. You may see a 5 second `cooling down...` message during each new log file import when the default key is in use. 

I have shipped this project with my own API key to save you from some extra painful steps. If you are tech savvy please read the following guide to generate and use your own API key for this project. To acquire an apiKey, follow these steps:

1. Visit [DJI Developer Technologies](https://developer.dji.com/user) and log in. Create an account if you don't have one, this is different registration than your existing DJI account, but you can login with your existing account as well. 
2. Fill out personal info (for those who value privacy, I’m not sure if it needs to be real info)
3. Click `CREATE APP`, choose `Open API` as the App Type, and provide the necessary details like `App Name`, `Category`, and `Description`.
4. After creating the app, activate it through the link sent to your email.
6. On your developer user page, find your app's details to retrieve the 31 character long alphanumeric ApiKey (labeled as the SDK key or APP key). Do not use the APP ID number, that is not your API key.

## Declaration

While some parts of this codebase were written with AI assistance (Claude Opus) for convinience, the entirety of OpenDroneLog is thoughtfully architected, manually tested before every release, and managed by me in my free time. Long-term maintenance remain my priority with this project as it grows. The `context.json` file provides a machine parsable high quality summary of the project overview, which is updated alongside the project for future references.
