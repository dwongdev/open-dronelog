| **Telemetry Analysis** | Comprehensive charts for all flight data |
| **Smart Tagging** | Automatic descriptive tags based on flight characteristics |
| **Advanced Filtering** | Powerful filtering, search, and sorting options |
| **Photo/Video Tracking** | Automatic detection and counting of media captures |
| **Battery Tracking** | Health monitoring and maintenance scheduling |
| **Manual Entry** | Record flights without log files |
| **Multiple Exports** | Export to CSV, JSON, GPX, and KML formats |
| **Full Backup** | Complete database backup and restore |
| **Single Instance** | Only one app window runs at a time (desktop) |

---

## Getting Started

### First Launch

When you first open Drone Logbook, you will see an empty dashboard with the import section expanded. The application automatically detects whether you have existing flights and adjusts the interface accordingly.

### Importing Your First Flight

1. Click **Browse Files** or drag-and-drop flight log files onto the import area
2. Select your DJI `.txt` files or Litchi `.csv` files
3. Wait for processing (the app will decrypt DJI logs, which requires internet on first import)
4. Your flights appear in the sidebar list

> [!NOTE]
> DJI V13+ flight logs require decryption keys from DJI's servers. You need to be online during the first import of each new log file. Once imported, the keys are cached locally for offline use.

---

## Interface Layout

The application is divided into three main areas:

### Left Sidebar

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **View Toggle** | Switch between "Flights" and "Overview" modes |
| **Import Section** | Drag-drop area and browse button (collapsible) |
| **Filters Section** | Date range, drone, battery, tags, and range filters (collapsible) |
| **Flight List** | All imported flights with selection, sorting, and search |

### Main Panel: Flights View

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Top** | Telemetry charts showing flight data over time |
| **Bottom** | Interactive 3D flight map with replay controls |

### Main Panel: Overview View

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Statistics Cards** | Total flights, distance, time, and data points |
| **Activity Heatmap** | Calendar view of flight activity |
| **Charts** | Flights by drone, battery, and duration breakdowns |
| **Cluster Map** | Geographic view of all flight locations |
| **Battery Health** | Per-battery health indicators |
| **Top Flights** | Longest and furthest flights |
| **Maintenance** | Track maintenance schedules for batteries and aircraft |

### Resizable Panels

- Drag the divider between sidebar and main panel to resize
- Drag the horizontal divider between charts and map to adjust the split

## Importing Flight Logs

### Supported Formats

| Format | File Extension | Source |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| DJI Flight Logs | `.txt` | Modern DJI format from DJI Fly app |
| Litchi CSV | `.csv` | Exported from Litchi app |

### Import Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Drag and Drop** | Drag files directly onto the import area |
| **Browse Button** | Click "Browse Files" to open a file picker |
| **Multiple Files** | Select multiple files at once for batch import |
| **Folder Sync** | Configure automatic import from a mounted folder |

### Duplicate Detection

The app automatically detects and prevents duplicate imports based on:

- Drone serial number
- Battery serial number
- Exact start time

> [!TIP]
> You can safely re-import files without creating duplicates. The app will skip any flights that already exist in your database.

### Import Progress

During import, you will see:

- Current file being processed
- Progress counter (X of Y files)
- Any errors or warnings

---

## Manual Flight Entry

For flights where no log file is available (e.g., flights with other apps, flights before you started logging, or when logs were lost), you can manually create flight records.

### Accessing Manual Entry

Click the **Manual Entry** button in the Import section of the sidebar.

### Required Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Flight Title** | Optional custom display name (defaults to Aircraft Name if left blank) |
| **Aircraft Name** | Name or model of the drone used |
| **Drone Serial** | Serial number of the aircraft |
| **Battery Serial** | Serial number of the battery used |
| **Date** | Flight date (calendar picker) |
| **Time** | Takeoff time in 12-hour format (converted to UTC internally) |
| **Duration** | Flight duration in seconds |
| **Home Latitude** | Takeoff location latitude (-90 to 90) |
| **Home Longitude** | Takeoff location longitude (-180 to 180) |

### Optional Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Total Distance** | Distance traveled (in current units) |
| **Max Altitude** | Maximum altitude reached (in current units) |
| **Notes** | Additional notes about the flight |

### After Creating a Manual Entry

- The flight is automatically tagged with "Manual Entry"
- Smart location tags (city, country, continent) are generated from the coordinates
- The flight appears in your flight list and overview statistics
- Manual entries can be exported, but since they have no telemetry data:
  - **CSV** exports contain a single row with home coordinates and metadata
  - **GPX** exports contain a waypoint at the home location
  - **KML** exports contain a point placemark at the home location

> [!NOTE]
> Manual entries have no telemetry data, so the charts panel will be empty and the map will show only the home location marker.

## Tips and Tricks

### Performance with Large Datasets

- The app uses DuckDB for fast queries even with thousands of flights
- Telemetry data is automatically downsampled for smooth charting
- If charts feel slow, try zooming into a smaller time range

### Organizing Flights

- Rename flights with meaningful names for easy searching
- Use manual tags for custom categorization (e.g., "Client Work", "Practice", "Scenic")
- Filter by tags to quickly find related flights

### Understanding Telemetry

| Observation | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| **VPS differs from GPS altitude** | VPS uses visual sensors and measures height above ground |
| **RC signal drops** | Often indicate obstacles or range limits |
| **Faster voltage drop** | Battery voltage drops faster in cold weather |

### Map Tips

- Use satellite view for better spatial context
- 3D terrain helps visualize elevation changes
- Color-by-height reveals altitude patterns at a glance

### Backup Strategy

- Export backups regularly, especially before updates
- Store backups in a separate location
- Backup files are compressed and portable

### Docker Users

- Mount your log folder for automatic import
- Set the `SYNC_LOGS_PATH` environment variable to enable folder sync
- Set the `SYNC_INTERVAL` environment variable with a cron expression for scheduled automatic sync (e.g., `0 0 */8 * * *` for every 8 hours)
- Data persists in the Docker volume and survives container updates

### Privacy

- All data stays on your device
- Decryption keys are cached locally after first use
- No telemetry or tracking
- Use "Hide Serial Numbers" for screenshots

### Single Instance (Desktop)

- The desktop app ensures only one instance runs at a time
- Opening a second instance will focus the existing window instead of launching a new one
- This prevents database conflicts and accidental duplicate windows

## Troubleshooting

### Flight Will Not Import

| Check | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **File format** | Ensure the file is a valid DJI `.txt` or Litchi `.csv` |
| **Internet connection** | Required for DJI log decryption on first import |
| **Isolate the issue** | Try importing a single file |

### Map Not Loading

| Check | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Internet connection** | Map tiles load from online sources |
| **Toggle views** | Try switching between satellite and street view |
| **Restart** | Refresh the page or restart the app |

### Charts Look Empty

| Check | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Telemetry data** | Verify the flight has telemetry data |
| **Flight duration** | Very short flights may have limited data |
| **Zoom level** | Try resetting zoom level |

### macOS "Damaged File" Error

> [!WARNING]
> This is a Gatekeeper warning for unsigned apps, not an actual corrupted file.

Run this command in Terminal:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Drone\ Logbook.app
```
